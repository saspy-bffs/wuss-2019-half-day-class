# Extra Credit Example 4. [Python w/ saspy] Imitate the SAS Macro Processor
#
# Type the following code into the cell labelled [ ]: immediately below, and then run that cell using Shift-Enter:

# sas_code_fragment = 'PROC MEANS DATA=sashelp.%s; RUN;'
# for dsn in ['fish', 'iris']:
#     sas_submit_return_value = sas.submit(sas_code_fragment % dsn, results='TEXT')
#     print_with_title(sas_submit_return_value['LST'], 'SAS results from PROC MEANS applies to sashelp.%s:' % dsn)

# Notes:

# 1. A string object named sas_code_fragment is created with templating placeholder %s, which will be filled using other
#    strings in subsequent uses of sas_code_fragment.
# 2. The output of PROC MEANS applied to SAS datasets sashelp.fish and sashelp.iris is then displayed.
# 3. The sas object represents a connection to a SAS session and was created when a previous cell was run. Here, sas
#    calls its submit method for each value of the for-loop indexing variable dsn, and the %s portion of
#    sas_code_fragment is replaced by the value of dsn. In other words, the following SAS code is submitted to the SAS
#    kernel:
#        proc means data=sashelp.fish; run;
#        proc means data=sashelp.iris; run;
#
# 4. The same outcome could also be achieved with the following SAS macro code:
#    %macro loop();
#         %let dsn_list = fish iris;
#         %do i = 1 %to 2;
#             %let dsn = %scan(&dsn_list.,&i.);
#             proc means data=sashelp.&dsn.;
#             run;
#         %end;
#    %mend;
#    %loop()
#
# However, note the following differences:
#   * Python allows us to concisely repeat an arbitrary block of code by iterating over a list using a for-loop. In
#     other words, the body of the for-loop (meaning everything indented underneath it, since Python uses indentation to
#     determine scope) is repeated for each string in the list ['fish','iris'].
#   * The SAS macro facility only provides do-loops based on numerical index variables (the macro variable i above), so
#     clever tricks like implicitly defined arrays (macro variable dsn_list above) need to be used together with
#     functions like %scan to extract a sequence of values.
