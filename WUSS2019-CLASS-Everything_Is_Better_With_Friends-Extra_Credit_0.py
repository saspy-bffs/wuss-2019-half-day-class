# define utility function to print linebreak-padded output with a title and optional line of 80 stars afterward
def print_with_title(output, title='', linebreaks_before=2, linebreaks_after=2, put_stars_after=True):
    print('\n' * linebreaks_before + title + '\n' * 2, output, '\n' * linebreaks_after, sep='')

# Extra Credit Example 1. [Python w/ saspy] Get information about a SAS session
#
# Uncomment the lines of code immediately below, and then execute:

# sas_submit_return_value = sas.submit('PROC PRODUCT_STATUS; RUN;')
# sas_submit_log = sas_submit_return_value['LOG']
# print_with_title(sas_submit_log, 'SAS log from PROC PRODUCT_STATUS:')

# Notes:
#
# 1. The SAS PRODUCT_STATUS procedure is called, and the following is printed:
#   * the log returned by PROC PRODUCT_STATUS
#
# 2. The sas object, which was created in a cell above, is a persistent connection to a SAS session, and its submit
#    method is used to submit the PROC PRODUCT_STATUS step to the SAS kernel. A dictionary is returned with the
#    following two key-value pairs:
#     - sas_submit_return_value['LST'] is a string comprising the results from executing PROC PRODUCT_STATUS, which is
#       empty because no output is produced by this procedure
#     - sas_submit_return_value['LOG'] is a string comprising the plain-text log resulting from executing PROC
#       PRODUCT_STATUS
# 3. Since a plain-text value is being printed, Python's print function is used to render the result.
#
# 4. Like the Python command help('modules') gives us information about the Python modules available to our Python
#    session, the PRODUCT_STATUS procedure gives us information about the products available in the SAS environment
#    we're connected to.
