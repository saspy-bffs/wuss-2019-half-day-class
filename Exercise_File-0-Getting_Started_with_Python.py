# print_with_title(platform.sys.version, 'Python version being used:')


# Notes:
#
# 1. Assuming a Python 3 kernel is associated with this Notebook, the following
#    should be printed:
#    * the Python version
#    * operating-system information
#
# 2. To increase performance, only a small number of modules in Python's
#    standard library are available by default, so the platform module needs to
#    be explicitly loaded.
#
# 3. This example illustrates three ways Python syntax differs from SAS:
#    * We don't need semicolons at the end of each statement. Unlike SAS,
#      semicolons are optional in Python, and they are typically only used to
#      separate multiple statements placed on the same line (e.g., this example
#      could be written on one line as follows: import platform;
#      print(platform.sys.version)).
#    * The code IMPORT PLATFORM would produce an error. Unlike SAS,
#      capitalization matters in Python.
#    * The platform object module invokes the sub-module object sys nested
#      inside of it, and sys invokes the object version nested inside of it.
#      Unlike SAS, dot-notation has a consistent meaning in Python and can be
#      used to reference objects nested inside each other at any depth. (Think
#      Russian nesting dolls or turduckens.)
#
# 4. If an error is displayed, an incompatible kernel has been chosen. This
#    script was developed using Python 3.7.3.

# help('modules')
# print_with_title('', linebreaks_before=0, linebreaks_after=0)


# Notes:
#
# 1. All Python modules available to be loaded by the Notebook's kernel should
#    be printed, including
#    * standard library modules (e.g., platform, which was used above),
#    * and any third-party modules that have been installed (e.g., pandas and
#    saspy, which should appear if the requirements.txt file is satisfied).
#
# 2. Python has a large standard library because of its "batteries included"
#    philosophy. In addition, numerous third-party modules are actively
#    developed and made freely available through sites like https://github.com/
#    and https://pypi.org/.
#
# 3. This example illustrates another way Python syntax differs from SAS:
#    * help("modules") would produce identical output. Unlike SAS, single and
#      double quotes always have identical behavior in Python.
#
# 4. Depending on the versions of the modules installed, warnings or errors
#    might appear.

# hello_world_str = 'Hello, PyCharm!'
# print_with_title(hello_world_str, 'The value of hello_world_str:')
# if hello_world_str == 'Hello, PyCharm!':
#     print_with_title(type(hello_world_str), 'The type of hello_world_str:')
# else:
#     print_with_title(
#         "The string doesn't have the expected value!",
#         'hello_world_str has been modified:'
#     )


# Notes:
#
# 1. A string (str for short) object named hello_world_str is created, and the
#    following are printed:
#    * the value of the string
#    * its type (which is <class 'str'>, reflecting Python primarily being an
#      object-oriented language with class-based inheritance)
#
# 2. This example illustrates three more ways Python syntax differs from SAS:
#    * hello_world_str can be assigned a value virtually anywhere, and it could
#      be reassigned a value later with a completely different type (e.g.,
#      hello_world_str = 42 would could type(hello_world_str) to become <class
#      'int'>). Unlike SAS, variables are dynamically typed in Python.
#    * The code if hello_world_str = 'Hello, PyCharm!' would produce an error.
#      Unlike SAS, single-equals (=) only ever means assignment, and
#      double-equals (==) only ever tests for equality, in Python.
#    * Removing indentation would also produce errors. Unlike SAS, indentation
#      is significant and used to determine scope in Python.
#
# 3. For additional practice, try any or all of the following:
#    * Change the value of hello_world_str when it's created.
#    * Remove the line print(), and look at how the output changes.
#    * Change the value that hello_world_str is compared against in the
#      if-statement.
