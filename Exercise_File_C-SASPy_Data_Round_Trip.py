# sas = SASsession()
# print_with_title(type(sas), 'The type of SAS session object sas:')


# Notes:
#
# 1. A SASsession object named sas is created, and the following are printed:
#    * confirmation a SAS session has been established
#    * the type of object sas (which is saspy.sasbase.SASsession)
#
# 2. As with the DataFrame object type above, SASsession is not built into
#    Python, so we had to import its definition from the saspy module at the
#    beginning of this file.
#
# 3. All subsequent exercises in this file will assume the object sas exists,
#    so please don't comment out the line creating it.

# fish_df = sas.sasdata2dataframe(table='fish', libref='sashelp')
# print_with_title(fish_df, 'The value of fish_df:')
# print_with_title(
#     fish_df.describe(),
#     'The Python equivalent of PROC MEANS using fish_df:'
# )
# print_with_title(fish_df.head(), 'The first five rows of fish_df:')


# Notes:
#
# 1. A DataFrame object named fish_df with dimensions 159x7 (159 rows and 7
#    columns) is created from the SAS dataset fish in the sashelp library, and
#    the following are printed:
#    * the type of object fish_df (which is
#      <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>)
#    * the first five rows of fish_df, which are at row indices 0 through 4
#      since Python uses zero-based indexing
#    * summary information about the 6 numerical columns of fish_df, which is
#      obtained by fish_df calling its describe method (the pandas equivalent
#      of the SAS MEANS procedure)
#
# 2. The sas object represents a connection to a SAS session and was created
#    in a previous exercise. Here, sas calls its sasdata2dataframe method to
#    access the SAS library sashelp defined within this SAS session and to load
#    the entire contents of SAS dataset sashelp.fish into the DataFrame
#    fish_df.
#
# 3. All subsequent exercises in this file will assume the object fish_df
#    exists, so please don't comment out the line creating it.
#
# 4. For additional practice, try any or all of the following:
#    * Pass a numerical parameter to the head method to see a different number
#      of rows (e.g., fish_df.head(42)).
#    * Change the head method to tail to see a different part of the dataset.
#    * To view other portions of fish_df, explore the more advanced indexing
#      methods loc and iloc explained at
#      https://brohrer.github.io/dataframe_indexing.html.

# fish_df_g   = fish_df.groupby('Species')
# fish_df_gs  = fish_df_g['Weight']
# fish_df_gsa = fish_df_gs.agg(['count', 'std', 'mean', 'min', 'max'])
# print_with_title(
#     fish_df_gsa,
#     'The Python equivalent of PROC MEANS with CLASS and VAR statements:'
# )


# Notes:
#
# 1. The DataFrame fish_df, which was created in an exercise above from the SAS
#    dataset sashelp.fish, is manipulated, and the following is printed:
#    * a table giving the number of rows, standard deviation, mean, min, and
#      max of Weight in fish_df when aggregated by Species
#
# 2. This is accomplished by creating a series of new DataFrames:
#    * The DataFrame fish_df_g is created from fish_df using the groupby method
#      to group rows by values in column 'Species'.
#    * The DataFrame fish_df_gs is created from fish_df_g by extracting the
#      'Weight' column using bracket notation.
#    * The DataFrame fish_df_gsa is created from fish_df_gs using the agg
#      method to aggregate by the functions in the list ['count', 'std',
#      'mean', 'min', 'max'].
#
# 3. Identical results could be obtained using the following SAS code:
#        proc means data=sashelp.fish std mean min max;
#             class species;
#             var Weight;
#        run;
#    However, while PROC MEANS operates on SAS datasets row-by-row from disk,
#    DataFrames are stored entirely in main memory. This allows any number of
#    DataFrame operations to be combined for on-the-fly reshaping using "method
#    chaining." In other words, fish_df_gsa could have instead been created
#    with the following one-liner, which avoids the need for intermediate
#    DataFrames (and thus executes much more quickly):
#        fish_df_gsa = fish_df.groupby('Species')['Weight'].agg(
#            ['count', 'std', 'mean', 'min', 'max']
#        )
#
# 3. All subsequent exercises in this file will assume the object fish_df_gsa
#    exists, so please don't comment out the line(s) creating it.
#
# 4. For additional practice, try any or all of the following:
#    * Move around and/or remove functions used for aggregation, and see how
#      the output changes.
#    * Change the variable whose values are summarized to 'Width'.
#    * Print out the results of using the one-liner version.

# sas.dataframe2sasdata(fish_df_gsa, table="fish_sds_gsa", libref="Work")
# sas_submit_return_value = sas.submit(
#     '''
#         PROC PRINT DATA=fish_sds_gsa;
#         RUN;
#     ''',
#     results='TEXT'
# )
# sas_submit_results = sas_submit_return_value['LST']
# print_with_title(
#     sas_submit_results,
#     'SAS results from PROC PRINT applies to new SAS dataset Work.fish_sds_gsa:'
# )


# Notes:
#
# 1. The DataFrame fish_df_gsa, which was created in an exercise above from the
#    SAS dataset sashelp.fish, is used to create the new SAS dataset
#    Work.fish_sds_gsa. The SAS PRINT procedure is then called, and the
#    following is printed:
#    * the output returned by PROC PRINT
#
# 2. The sas object, which was created in a cell above, is a persistent
#    connection to a SAS session, and two of its methods are used as follows:
#    * The dataframe2sasdata method writes the contents of the DataFrame
#      fish_df_gsa to the SAS dataset fish_sds_gsa stored in the Work library.
#      (Note: The row indexes of the DataFrame fish_df_gsa are lost when the
#      SAS dataset fish_sds_gsa is created.)
#    * The submit method is used to submit the PROC PRINT step to the SAS
#      kernel, and a dictionary is returned with the following two key-value
#      pairs:
#      - sas_submit_return_value['LST'] is a string comprising the results from
#        executing PROC PRINT, which will be in plain text because the
#        results='TEXT' was used
#      - sas_submit_return_value['LOG'] is a string comprising the plain-text
#        log resulting from executing PROC PRINT
#
# 3. Python strings surrounded by single quotes (e.g., 'Hello, World!') cannot
#    be written across multiple lines of code, whereas strings surrounded by
#    triple quotes (e.g., the argument to the submit method) can.
#
# 4. For additional practice, try any or all of the following:
#    * Print out the SAS log.
#    * Change the SAS procedure used to interact with SAS dataset
#      Work.fish_sds_gsa (e.g., try PROC CONTENTS).
